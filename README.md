# Fake_BlueArchive_chat
a dialogue page that mimics the BlueArchive, for Creating fanfiction

with only HTML and CSS _(may be transitory)_
IMG from [blue archive](https://kivo.wiki/)  and  [arknights](https://prts.wiki/w/%E9%A6%96%E9%A1%B5)

use colorBag() to desplay used-color in console

next goal

-  add  arrow on chat bubble
-  (further)add send animation with timer
- (more further) modular rebuild   let user can add dialogue on client 
_just a unrealistic dream? maybe ,I know someone had been created project like this but i want try  starting from zero_
